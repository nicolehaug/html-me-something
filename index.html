                        <p>In November of 17 I hopped a plane for Puerto Vallarta with my girlfriend. Our plan was to visit for day of the dead festival and maybe do some surfing in Sayulita.</p>
                        <p>Puerto Vallarta has art lined up along their beach in November in prep for their Day of the dead parade usually held on November 2.</p>

                        <p>We got to see some cool architecture. Pictured below is the local church in Puerto Vallarta.</p>

                        <p>Our boutique hotel was a good mix of hostel meets hotel, with a large honor bar where you can make your own drinks.</p>

                        <p>The actual day of the dead parade is not a large one, but fun nonetheless.</p>

                        <p>My favorite part of this trip was boogie boarding in Sayulita. A very quaint, hippie ish town known for its gypsy like atmosphere and friendly locals.</p>
